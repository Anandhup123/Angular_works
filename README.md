# Angular Study Project

This project is a comprehensive Angular application created for study purposes. It covers various fundamental Angular concepts and showcases different forms of data binding and form handling techniques.

## Features

### 1. Reactive Forms
- Implements reactive forms to manage complex form structures.
- Includes form validation and dynamic form controls.

### 2. Template-Driven Forms
- Demonstrates the use of template-driven forms for simpler form scenarios.
- Integrates form validation using Angular's built-in directives.

### 3. One-Way Data Binding
- Utilizes one-way data binding for displaying data from the component to the view.
- Helps maintain a clear separation of concerns between the component logic and the template.

### 4. Two-Way Data Binding
- Implements two-way data binding using `[(ngModel)]` for synchronizing the component and the view.
- Useful for scenarios where user input directly affects the componentâ€™s state.

### 5. Style Binding
- Demonstrates dynamic style binding to apply CSS styles based on component state.
- Includes examples of both inline style binding and class binding.
